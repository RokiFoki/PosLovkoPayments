# Payments 

Payments is a web service used by PosLovko in order to make payments. 
Running it should be as simple as building it in Visual Studio and running it.

Make sure, the endpoint is on same address as PosLovko's config.js file is configured (feel free to update config.js)

Also, before running the solution right click on the main project and click on Manage User Secrets and paste following code in editor:
`{
  "ApiKey": "huidhasjk280u3uhd71jaoi9)UDjo832103zl!",
  "Secret":  "qwe901309)ISD)A9i9d0i3d0!)@(#*()DOKP-1Ijida"
}`
